# Physics Adjustments Summary

The following physics parameters have been adjusted to allow full 360-degree rotations:

1. **Gravity**: Reduced from -9.8 to -6.5 (33% reduction)
   - This makes it easier to build momentum against gravity

2. **Max Swing Force**: Increased from 5 to 12 (140% increase)
   - Allows players to apply much stronger forces when swinging

3. **Damping Factor**: Reduced from 0.99 to 0.995 (50% less damping)
   - Preserves momentum better, allowing energy to build up over multiple swings

4. **Release Velocity**: Increased forward momentum from 2 to 3 (50% increase)
   - Helps maintain speed during bar transfers

5. **Coordinate System**: Updated to work with Z-axis positioning
   - Swing physics now correctly operate in the Z-plane
   - Gymnast rotates around X-axis for proper visual effect

## Testing Instructions

To achieve full rotations:
1. Start swinging by holding left/right arrow keys
2. Time your key presses with the swing rhythm
3. Build momentum over 4-6 swings
4. Release (spacebar) at the peak of your swing for maximum effect

The physics are now tuned to make full rotations challenging but achievable!
